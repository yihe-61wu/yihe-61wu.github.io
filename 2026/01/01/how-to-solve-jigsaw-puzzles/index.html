2025. We pulled out an old jigsaw puzzle and cracked on it. As you must
know, a jigsaw puzzle is always initiated in a ‘cracked’ state, and the
goal is to assemble (uncrack?) the pieces into a final, full picture. So
started our quality time.</p>
<p>There were a few challenges. The jigsaw puzzle consisted of small
pieces, the Scottish daylight in this time of winter was poetically
soft, and both my partner and I had had our eyesights deteriorated
(luckily not too much) in the past year(s), plus everything feeling
misplaced due to the jet lag.</p>
<p>As we became stuck more frequently and for longer, in my mind grew a
daunting idea–This old jigsaw puzzle may have lost a few pieces–It would
never be complete again…<span id="more"></span></p>
<p>After an hour or two, <em>‘One is all, All is
one’</em><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"><span
class="hint--top hint--error hint--medium hint--rounded hint--bounce"
aria-label="A quote from *Fullmetal Alchmist*--perhaps more relevant to jigsaw puzzles figuratively than literally.">1</span></a></sup>.</p>
<p>Indeed, the entire process felt like conducting scientific research,
similar to the analogy commonly attributed to <em>The Structure of
Scientific Revolutions</em> by Thomas S. Kuhn, but different due to the
lack of the full picture (the dominant paradigm). In terms of personal
feelings, the most similar part was to fight against the daunting idea
that failure was inevitable, to keep faith in the completeness of the
puzzle, and to proceed with constant patience and intermittent
insights.</p>
<h1 id="a-machine-approach">A Machine Approach</h1>
<p>Apparently, compared to human beings, machines are much more patient,
tireless with repetitive work (if well powered and maintained).
Additionally, we try to make them smart(er) by embedding Artificial
Intelligence (AI) and to build AI by formalising insights, strategies,
tricks, etc., as algorithms.</p>
<h2 id="thus-spoke-gemini">Thus Spoke Gemini</h2>
<p>So, this morning I asked Gemini (3 Flash, as on 01/01/2026), ‘are
there any AI system that can solve jigsaw puzzles’? Gemini did some
online search and gave the response below:</p>
<hr />
<p>Yes, there are AI systems that can solve jigsaw puzzles. This is an
active area of research and development in <strong>computer
vision</strong> and <strong>machine learning</strong>, especially using
techniques like deep learning and genetic algorithms.</p>
<h3 id="how-ai-solves-jigsaw-puzzles">🧩 How AI Solves Jigsaw
Puzzles</h3>
<p>AI systems tackle the jigsaw puzzle problem, which is essentially a
challenging combinatorial optimization task, by breaking it down into
several steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Image Processing/Piece Recognition:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The system first needs to identify the individual puzzle pieces
from an input image (like a scan or a photo of the scattered
pieces).</p></li>
<li><p>This involves techniques like <strong>edge detection</strong>,
<strong>contour identification</strong>, and
<strong>segmentation</strong> to isolate each piece.</p></li>
<li><p>For physical puzzles, this is often handled by a robotic arm
system that uses an attached camera and object detection models (like
YOLO) to see and track the pieces.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Feature Extraction and Compatibility
Measurement:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The AI extracts features from each piece, focusing on two main
types of information:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Shape/Geometry:</strong> Analyzing the intricate shape of
the edges (tabs and blanks) to determine which pieces physically fit
together.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Visual/Color Information:</strong> Analyzing the color
and pattern along the edges to see if the image flows seamlessly across
the boundary.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Deep Learning</strong> models, such as <strong>Siamese
Neural Networks (SNN)</strong>, are often trained to calculate a
<strong>compatibility measure</strong>—a score that predicts how well
two pieces should fit together both geometrically and visually.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Piece Orientation and Reordering/Assembly:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Once compatibility scores are available for all possible adjacent
pairs, the system uses a <strong>solver algorithm</strong> to assemble
the entire puzzle.</p></li>
<li><p>Since the number of possible arrangements grows exponentially
(<span class="math inline"><em>N</em>!</span> for <span
class="math inline"><em>N</em></span> pieces), algorithms are needed to
efficiently explore the solution space.</p></li>
<li><p>Common solving strategies include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Genetic Algorithms (GA):</strong> These algorithms
simulate natural selection, iteratively combining “parent” solutions
(partial assemblies) that have high-fitness (high compatibility scores)
to create better “child” solutions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS):</strong> These methods treat puzzle solving as a sequential
decision-making process, where the AI learns the optimal
<em>actions</em> (which piece to place next and where) to maximize the
reward (a completed or highly-compatible puzzle). Examples include
systems like <strong>Alphazzle</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Combinatorial Optimization:</strong> Framing the problem
as finding the shortest path in a graph or a linear assignment problem,
which can be solved using efficient algorithms like <strong>Dijkstra’s
algorithm</strong> or techniques like <strong>Quadratic
Programming</strong>.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>These systems can range from purely software-based tools that solve
digital versions of puzzles, to <strong>AI-powered robotic
systems</strong> that physically manipulate real-world puzzle
pieces.</p>
<p>Would you be interested in learning more about the <strong>different
types of AI algorithms</strong> used for puzzle solving, like Genetic
Algorithms versus Deep Reinforcement Learning?</p>
<hr />
<p>The three main steps are almost the same as I had imagined. I haven’t
verified all the details, but <a
target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://deepai.org/publication/alphazzle-jigsaw-puzzle-solver-with-deep-monte-carlo-tree-search">Alphazzle</a>
seemed legit<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"><span
class="hint--top hint--error hint--medium hint--rounded hint--bounce"
aria-label="I haven&#39;t reproduced all the results so you trust either me or the authors. It&#39;s commendable if you trust neither and try to reproduce their work--I&#39;d appreciate it more if you let me know your results.">2</span></a></sup>.
I also like Gemini’s mention of physical puzzles, because it’s not
trivial for a robot to visually recognise and physically move all the
pieces.</p>
<h2 id="caveats-and-assumptions">Caveats and Assumptions</h2>
<p>Real-world ambient lighting is constantly changing. Small, individual
pieces may not contain sufficient underlying visual features of the
final picture. Perfeclty assembled pieces still have cracks–they may
interfere with, if not dominate, some underlying visual features. It
takes some effort to seggrate pieces from a pile, pieces facing down
need to be flipped over, and during assembly pieces need to be lifted
and put down. These tasks can be particularly challenging for a robot
hand, because jigsaw puzzle pieces, many made of paperboard, are
brittle. As ours, they can even be thin and tiny.</p>
<p>For now, let’s pretend there exist a perfect robot system capable of
accurate and fast visual recognition and precise and subtle piece
manipulation. In other words, let’s focus solely on the computational
problem of how to reorder all the pieces based on their appearance. For
greater formalisation, we further assume individual pieces have the
identical shape of a square–no curved sides, knobs, or sockets–so that
the appearance of any piece is entirely and only determined by its
pixels.</p>
<h2 id="model-complexity">Model Complexity</h2>
<p>Despite all the abstractions and simplifications, the computational
model remains difficult. As Gemini states, ‘the number of possible
arrangements grows exponentially (<span
class="math inline"><em>N</em>!</span> for <span
class="math inline"><em>N</em></span> pieces)’.</p>
<p>I didn’t ask Gemini how this statement was obtained, as I expected
this <span class="math inline"><em>N</em>!</span> scaling by considering
the following: Whenever <span class="math inline"><em>K</em></span>
pieces are correctly assembled, one can arbitrarily pick one empty slot
adjacent to the assembled <span class="math inline"><em>K</em></span>
pieces, repeat step 2 (Feature Extraction and Compatibility Measurement)
<span class="math inline">4</span> times (corresponding to <span
class="math inline">4</span> directions) for each of the remaining <span
class="math inline"><em>N</em> − <em>K</em></span> pieces, and then
determine the new configuration that maximises the compatibility.
Therefore, <span class="math inline">4(<em>N</em> − 1)!</span>
iterations are required in total.</p>
<p>Note the operation of picking one empty slot (that indeed needs to be
filled) is feasible and inexpensive, because we assume, as most jigsaw
puzzles, the final, full picture is a rectangle of <span
class="math inline"><em>L</em> × <em>W</em></span>. Even if <span
class="math inline"><em>L</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>W</em></span> are unknown beforehand, one can
factorise <span class="math inline"><em>N</em></span>. If there are
multiple ways of factorisation, it’s more likely for <span
class="math inline"><em>L</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>W</em></span> to be as close as possible.</p>
<p>While such weaker assumptions will lead to more iterations, I have no
intention to go into the details to prove both lower and upper bounds
grow exponentially–explicitly for a usual jigsaw puzzle that is 2D–as an
exponential growth can be clearly shown with a 1D jigsaw puzzle.</p>
<p>A 1D jigsaw puzzle can be easily constructed by vertically (or
horizontally) cutting a rectangular (full) figure into thin slices.
Again, starting with <span class="math inline"><em>N</em></span> slices,
the goal is to reorder them and assemble them into a final, full figure.
In this 1D setup, at iteration <span
class="math inline"><em>K</em></span> there are exactly <span
class="math inline">2</span> empty slots on the left or right of the
assembled <span class="math inline"><em>K</em></span> pieces, one should
maximise compatibility by testing each of the remaining <span
class="math inline"><em>N</em> − <em>K</em></span> pieces exactly <span
class="math inline">2</span> times (upright and upside down) in both
slots, and therefore in total <span
class="math inline">4(<em>N</em> − 1)!</span> iterations, again, are
required (but we do not worry about which empty slot to pick at
all).</p>
<h1 id="human-like-approach">Human(-like) Approach</h1>
<p>While the machine approach guarantees success by iteratively adding
jigsaw puzzle pieces one by one to a focused well-assebled group, my
partner and I did not take the approach as it felt non-human and
boring.</p>
<p>We built ‘islands’ first. We picked small number of pieces into a
handful of groups based on visual similarity, similar to compatibility
but an instinct first approximation and then with trial and error
assemble some pieces into an island and others into another one. We
worked simultaneously with a few islands. They were isoldated and grew
first at the beginning. As we proceeded, it became harder and harder to
find new pieces to add to them. However, as the islands grew bigger, it
became easier for us to spot a way to merge/connect two islands into a
bigger one. There were two factors: the visual semantics became clearer,
and there were less remaining, isolated pieces.</p>
<p>Amongst modern AI models, visual transforms may be a particularly
effectivfe candidate for solving jigsaw puzzles by emulating such
human-like fast-and-slow thinking. Unlike other visual recognition
tasks, solving jigsaw puzzles requires inferring spatial proximity from
visual semantics. Most other visual AI models have built-in inductive
bias of spatial proximity–they learn semantics based on spatial
proximity, a one-way relation, while a visual transform are free from
such bias and learns a two-way relation.</p>
<h2 id="improved-efficiency">Improved Efficiency</h2>
<p>In general, this is a clever strategy (worked well for us!). Assuming
the total <span class="math inline"><em>N</em></span> pieces can be
quickly sorted into <span class="math inline">2</span> piles, one
consisting of <span class="math inline"><em>M</em></span> pieces that
will be assembled into an island and the rest <span
class="math inline"><em>N</em> − <em>M</em></span> pieces not so clear.
Now step 2 needs to be repeated for <span
class="math inline">4(<em>M</em> − 1)!</span> in total for the first
pile, followed by <span
class="math inline">4(<em>N</em> − <em>M</em>)!</span> times for the
remaining pieces, and <span
class="math inline">4(<em>M</em> − 1)! + 4(<em>N</em> − <em>M</em>)! &lt; 4(<em>N</em> − 1)!</span>
is always true! Following the same reasoning, one can conclude quicker
reordering (less iterations of step 2) is achieveable if all the pieces
can be sorted into more than <span class="math inline">2</span> piles
based on the instinct approximation.</p>
<p>The main caveat of the above reasoning is that we have overlooked the
cost of the instinct approximation completely. For rigorosity, let’s
assume its cost to be <span
class="math inline"><em>c</em><sub>1</sub></span> and the cost of
careful compatibility measurement to be <span
class="math inline"><em>c</em><sub>2</sub></span> (per piece). Then, the
overall costs of the human-like and purely machine approach are <span
class="math inline"><em>c</em><sub>1</sub><em>N</em> + 4<em>c</em><sub>2</sub>[(<em>M</em> − 1)! + (<em>N</em> − <em>M</em>)!]</span>
and <span
class="math inline">4<em>c</em><sub>2</sub>(<em>N</em> − 1)!</span>.</p>
<p>For the human-like approach to improve efficiency,</p>
<p><span
class="math display"><em>c</em><sub>1</sub><em>N</em> + 4<em>c</em><sub>2</sub>[(<em>M</em> − 1)! + (<em>N</em> − <em>M</em>)!] − 4<em>c</em><sub>2</sub>(<em>N</em> − 1)! &lt; 0</span></p>
<p>which gives</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$ \frac{c_1}{c_2} &lt; \frac{(N-1)! -
(M-1)! - (N-M)!}{N/4} $$</span></p>
<p>Note first in the right hand side (RHS) <span
class="math inline"><em>M</em></span> is symmetric about <span
class="math inline">(<em>N</em> + 1)/2</span>, and the closer to it
<span class="math inline"><em>M</em></span> is, the greater the RHS is.
Unless <span class="math inline"><em>M</em> = 1</span> or <span
class="math inline"><em>N</em></span>, even when <span
class="math inline"><em>M</em> = 2</span> or <span
class="math inline"><em>N</em> − 1</span>, the RHS is</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$ \frac{(N-1)! - 1 - (N-2)!}{N/4} =
\frac{(N-2)(N-2)!-1}{N/4} $$</span></p>
<p>which is greater than <span class="math inline">1</span>, as long as
<span class="math inline"><em>N</em> ≥ 4</span>.</p>
<p>Therefore, as <span
class="math inline"><em>c</em><sub>1</sub> &lt; <em>c</em><sub>2</sub></span>
is implicitly assumed, the human-like approach is guaranteed to improve
the overall efficiency. This is perhaps not surprising, as <span
class="math inline"><em>c</em><sub>1</sub></span> incurs a cost linear
but <span class="math inline"><em>c</em><sub>2</sub></span> factorial in
the number of pieces (<span class="math inline"><em>N</em></span>).</p>
