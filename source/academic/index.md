<font size=4>**Profile**</font>
I am a research associate in the Cardiff University Brain Research Imaging Centre. My research interest is in neural computation, both artificial and non-artificial. At the macroscopic level, I study human-like machine learning. At the microscopic level, I am interested in the interplay between structures and functions in a single nerve cell.
