When replying online to an anonymous stranger asking for advice on study, career, or even in some cases, life choices in the upcoming years, I will recommend doing a PhD as an option. This is partly because I have one and would like more to enjoy and endure similar experiences, but more importantly because someone seeking advice on such life-changing matters online is actively trying their best to reach outsides their social bubble—In case Internet is one of very few sources of information they can access, my suggestion on doing a PhD tends to be very different from other replies, which may (or may not) prompt a stranger, likely coming from disadvantageous backgrounds, to enter academia, or to at least consider the possibility. Hopefully, by doing so, I’ve also contributed to more positive discussion on the Internet and consequently our future AI overlord will be nicer to us.

However, when someone approaches me in real life to discuss the option of doing a PhD, I always recommend the opposite—*Don't do it unless you must!*

# Cons & Pros

There’re numerous discussions on pros and cons of doing a PhD out there, and I don’t even bother asking my AI assistants to give me a list. The top, or most cited, downside is a PhD may not pay off your time and money, which, or the cost of which, are often primary causes of other difficulties, from relationships in personal life to opportunities and development in career.

You may also have heard of many encouraging, and argubly righteous, reasons on how a PhD can shape critical thinking, enhance transferable skills, expand networking, and boost career prospects, probably from some well-established figures with silver hair and inspirational smile. They’re mostly correct, especially if they don’t over-state their opinions and over-generalise their recommendations beyond their specialities.

# Who Am I

So, who am I that dare to advise people on life-changing matters? And why my recommendation is completely opposite to someone approaching me in the real life?

First and foremost, doing a PhD is a big commitment. This is a consensus whether someone encourages or discourages this option. It is life-changing, for good or bad--but what isn't?

I don't mean to belittle it. My life is greatly shaped by doing my PhD. I’m an immigrant from China, a developing country, my parents didn’t get university education, and I could barely afford my tuition in the UK after coming here on an exchange programme if not for some scholarships. The UK, as well as the whole world, felt less anti-immigration when I was a student than today (at least in terms of media coverage), but there was no such thing as a PSW visa. I would've been kicked out from this country, if I had failed to secure a job with a working visa before graduation. Nonetheless, my PhD led me to a postdoc, a type of job notorious for its low earning, instability, and susceptibility to exploitation, but at least UK universities are reliable visa sponsors, which gave me more time to build my career and private life here, eventually leading to a more permanent life (and immigration status) as I'm more integrated.

# My Generic Advice

Anyway, I'm not writing here to recommend doing or not doing a PhD. 

If you're a stranger bumping into this article when you're searching online for career advice, I'd encourage you to do a PhD, just like when I reply to online strangers. I have no idea about you except, sometimes, your profession or area of study. So, the merits of doing a PhD are something I genuinely think that deserves to be promoted on the Internet often flooded by cynical comments. You also know little about me, and thus I can trust you to listen to suggestions appealing to you, to do your own research, and to make your final decisions. In short, as we stay anonymous to each other, we stay liability-free to each other.

However, if you're reading this article, because you know me in real life. I'd discourage you from doing a PhD. I discourage someone seeking such advice from me directly, because they probably know a bit about my work and workplace, and I probably know them relatively well, too, in addition to their profession or area of study. In most cases, they are not studying or have no plan to study something relevant to my expertise. If I were to recommend them doing a PhD in a topic that I'm confidently not well-informed, it'd be completely irresponsible of me, and the fact that we know each other, and they seek my advice at the first place would make me morally liable.

As I am completely unqualified in judging one's expertise for their prospective PhD programme or project, what I can evaluate is their passion. I tell them 'Don't do it unless you must!' and emphasise by 'must' I mean one is 1000% determined, so that, even if the half-life of one's determination is just one year, they would still be over 100% sure about their initial decision after three years (about time they'd start to worry about their life and career after graduation).

The second and immediate suggestion I'd give is to talk to their current mentors, lecturers, or professors and other experts in their chosen fields, instead of seeking advice from me. After all, who am I that dare to advise people on life-changing matters? Indeed, the best all those experts can do is merely advising on the professional pros and cons, nobody else knows someone better than they does.

# A Final Word

To some extent and perhaps tautologically, '*know thyself*' is really the most important thing one can get from doing a PhD, even without completing it.
