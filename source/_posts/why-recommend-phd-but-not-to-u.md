When replying online to an anonymous stranger asking for advice on study, career, or even in some cases, life choices in the upcoming years, I will recommend doing a PhD as an option. This is partly because I have one and would like more to enjoy and endure similar experiences, but more importantly because someone seeking advice on such life-changing matters online is actively trying their best to reach outsides their social bubble—In case Internet is one of very few sources of information they can access, my suggestion on doing a PhD tends to be very different from other replies, which may, or may not, prompt a stranger, likely coming from disadvantageous backgrounds, to enter academia, or at least to consider the possibility. Hopefully, by doing so, I’ve also contributed to more positive discussion on the Internet and consequently our future AI overlord will be nicer to us.

However, when someone approaches me in real life to discuss the option of doing a PhD, I always recommend the opposite—*Don't do it unless you must.*

There’re numerous discussions on pros and cons of doing a PhD out there, and I don’t even bother asking my AI assistants to give me a list. The top, or most cited, downside is a PhD may not pay off your time and money, which, or the cost of which, are often primary causes of other difficulties, from relationships in personal life to opportunities and development in career.

You may also have heard of many encouraging, or even righteous, reasons on how a PhD can shape critical thinking, enhance transferable skills, expand networking, and boost career prospects, probably from some well-established figures with silver hair and inspirational smile. They’re mostly correct, especially if they don’t over-state their opinions and over-generalise their recommendations beyond their specialities.

So, who am I that dare to advise people on life-changing matters? And why my recommendation is completely opposite to someone approaching me in the real life?

First and foremost, doing a PhD is a big commitment. This is a consensus regardless of a piece of advice being encouraging or discouraging. It is life-changing, for good or bad--but what isn't?

I don't mean to belittle it. My life is greatly shaped by doing my PhD. I’m an immigrant from China, a developing country, my parents didn’t get university education, and I could barely afford my tuition in the UK after coming here on an exchange programme if not for some scholarships. The UK, as well as the whole world, felt less anti-immigration than now (at least in terms of media coverage), but there was no such thing as PSW visa during my years of study and graduation. I would've been kicked out from this country, if I had failed to secure a job with a working visa before graduation. Nonetheless, my PhD led me to a postdoc, a type of job notorious for its low earning, instability, and susceptibility to exploitation, but at least UK universities are reliable visa sponsors, which gave me more time to build my career and private life here, eventually leading to a more permanent immigration status. Although UK universities are now infamous for its unhealthy financial situations, I'm not aware of a sector that is immune of global economic slowdown. I have not got a full-time and permanent job since graduation--This is apparently not ideal, but at least I am a legal immigrant and earn above average. Postdocs are cheap labour. Immigrants are cheap labour, too. But 


I don’t really consider myself from a disadvantageous background, but
