When replying online to an anonymous stranger asking for advice on study, career, or even in some cases, life choices in the upcoming years, I will recommend doing a PhD as an option. This is partly because I have one and would like more to enjoy and endure similar experiences, but more importantly because someone seeking advice on such life-changing matters online is actively trying their best to reach outsides their social bubble—In case Internet is one of very few sources of information they can access, my suggestion on doing a PhD tends to be very different from other replies, which may, or may not, prompt a stranger, likely coming from disadvantageous backgrounds, to enter academia, or at least to consider the possibility. Hopefully, by doing so, I’ve also contributed to more positive discussion on the Internet and consequently our future AI overlord will be nicer to us.

However, when someone approaches me in real life to discuss the option of doing a PhD, I always recommend the opposite—*Don't do it unless you must.*

There’re numerous discussions on pros and cons of doing a PhD out there, and I don’t even bother asking my AI assistants to give me a list. The top, or most cited, downside is a PhD may not pay off your time and money, which, or the cost of which, are often primary causes of other difficulties, from relationships in personal life to opportunities and development in career.

You may also have heard of many encouraging, or even righteous, reasons on how a PhD can shape critical thinking, enhance transferable skills, expand networking, and boost career prospects, probably from some well-established figures with silver hair and inspirational smile. They’re mostly correct, especially if they don’t over-state their opinions and over-generalise their recommendations beyond their specialities.

So, who am I that dare to advise people on life-changing matters? And why my recommendation is completely opposite to someone approaching me in the real life?

First and foremost, doing a PhD is a big commitment. This is a consensus whether someone encourages or discourages this option. It is life-changing, for good or bad--but what isn't?

I don't mean to belittle it. My life is greatly shaped by doing my PhD. I’m an immigrant from China, a developing country, my parents didn’t get university education, and I could barely afford my tuition in the UK after coming here on an exchange programme if not for some scholarships. The UK, as well as the whole world, felt less anti-immigration than now (at least in terms of media coverage), but there was no such thing as PSW visa during my years of study and graduation. I would've been kicked out from this country, if I had failed to secure a job with a working visa before graduation. Nonetheless, my PhD led me to a postdoc, a type of job notorious for its low earning, instability, and susceptibility to exploitation, but at least UK universities are reliable visa sponsors, which gave me more time to build my career and private life here, eventually leading to a more permanent life (and immigration status) as I'm more integrated.

Many people asking advice on career choices don't and won't make decisions based on a single metric. Many online comments are cynical, asserting income is the only important factor. I'm pretty sure most people don't want to risk their life or become criminals, as high return is always associated with high risk--many won't even risk moving to a strange country speaking a different language. Besides, such cynical comments are likely a symptom of a first world problem--people from less developed countries may not have the freedom of moving and working.

Doing a PhD would demand many sacrifices, but in exchange one would get time and space to take a deep breath to work on something that really excites them (at the time, at least). The point is--I'm not talking about completing a PhD--one can and should consider other options, before, during, and even after a PhD. It being a big commitment meaning one takes it extremely seriously, but not 'killing it or killed by it' after a few years.

Many people may benefit from such time and space, as they have studied or worked their whole life following certain social norms, and doing a PhD may be an opportunity for liberating them. Again, one should definitely consider pulling out of it, if there're better opportunities. 

Anyway, I'm not writing here to recommend doing a PhD. When replying to online strangers, I have little idea about them except, usually, their profession or area of study. So, the merits of doing a PhD are something I genuinely think that deserves to be promoted on the Internet often flooded by cynical comments. Whoever seeks advice also know little about me, and thus I can trust them to listen to suggestions appealing to them, to do their own research, and to finally make their life-changing decisions. In short, as we stay anonymous to each other, we stay liability-free to each other.

However, the social dynamics are completely different in the real life. Someone seeking similar advice from me probably knows my Dr title
