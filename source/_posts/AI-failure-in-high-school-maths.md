I've been doing more teaching in the recent years, and it has become my habit to test my AI assistants before asking my students to solve a question, especially for the formal ones as I'd like 'somebody' else to verify my own working.

I use ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini (ordered alphabetically) regularly. Apparently, there are many cases in which I can't use them, according to the university policy or for my concerns over data privacy.

Today, I found this interesting example, a question from the May 2020 Pearson Edexcel Level 3 GCE paper on Further Mathematics (paper reference: 8FM0/01)--ChatGPT was the only one that succeeded in its first attempt.

You may want to attempt this question yourself before coming back and reading about Claude and Gemini' failure.

In all cases, I just pasted the above snapshot into a new chat with the AI, and the prompt is simply 'Please solve this step by step'. 

For the record, I'm using the unpaid versions: ChatGPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, and Gemini 2.5 Flash. Gemini 2.5 Pro also succeeded, but I tested this later and I'm not sure if its global memory somehow played a critical role.

If you have solved this problem, or even just attempted it with a few early steps, you should be able to see where it made an error confidently, leading to the wrong answer in the end.

I'm not bothered to take more snapshots, as hopefully you can see the same error as before ...

To be fair, after spotting the error, I followed up with this question: '_I'm confused. z2 and z4 lie on the horizontal axis, not in any quadrant?_' And they were able to find the error and correct the answer. Also, I guess any paid version would perhaps be much better at this high-school level mathematical reasoning.

Anyway, I'm not trying to use an anecdote to undermine the advance of generative AI--They are helpful and powerful, and that's why I use them regularly. However, I do worry about my students using AI without critical thinking, or, more speculatively, a future that knowledge is more centralised and harnessed only by those who can afford it.
