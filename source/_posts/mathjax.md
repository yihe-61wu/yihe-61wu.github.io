# Why

Although my research is mostly about or inspired from brains, I identify myself largely as a mathematician. LaTeX is a must-have, especially when I'm writing (blogging) something technical

For example, below is something from my undergraduate (handwritten) notebook that becomes quite puzzling to me now:

$$\begin{align}
\forall R > 0, U \in D'(I; R), X(U) \in H(D'(I; R)) \\
\exists n \in \mathbb{Z}, X(U) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{+\infty} C_n (U - I)^n \\
\forall m \in \mathbb{Z}, \exists n < m, C_n \neq 0
\end{align}$$

Rendering LaTeX wasn't possible within old blogging platforms I used, which was fine as I blogged mostly non-technical, personal thoughts in Chinese, but no longer fitted for this blog.
