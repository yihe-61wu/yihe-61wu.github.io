My partner and I were dealing with jet lag yesterday, Hogmaney of 2025. We pulled out an old jigsaw puzzle and cracked on it--Apparently, as you must know, a jigsaw puzzle is always initiated in a 'cracked' state, and the goal is to put (uncrack?) the pieces together. So started our quality time.

There were a few challenges. The jigsaw puzzle consisted of small pieces, the Scottish daylight in this time of winter was poetically soft, and both my partner and I had had our eyesights deteriorated (luckily not too much) in the past year(s), plus everything feeling misplaced due to jet lag.

More seriously, we didn't have the full (completed) picture. As we produced a few 'islands' and became more frequently stuck with how to expand and/or connect them, in my mind grew a daunting idea--This old jigsaw puzzle may have lost a few pieces--It would never be complete again...

After an hour or two, *'One is all, All is one'*[^1].
