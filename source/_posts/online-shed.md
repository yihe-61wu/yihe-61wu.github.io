I used to write too much without reflection. Then I started reflection, reflected too much, and stopped writing—almost the same as composed by [Xin Qiji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xin_Qiji) in his famous poetry ([translation](https://chinesepoemsinenglish.blogspot.com/2012/02/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) quoted):
> *When young I never did know the taste of woe or sorrow,*
> *Up to the top floor, I loved to go;*
> *Up to the top floor, I loved to go—*
> *For to compose new verses, I feigned my sorrow and woe.*

—except that woe feels too strong a word for my experience, and that I like the Japanese proverb:
> *Only smoke and fools love high places*.

To me, while views from high places are figuratively stunning, gazing up at something higher are literately stunning, especially when it stands on the same level as mine—a feeling of falling overwhelms me, yet I can't tell whether it or me will fall down and/or apart.

So, while the word-to-word translation to the new name of this personal web-site of mine would be *'Cloud Shed'*, this site is just a shed for me to store my gadgets and crafts, and it happens to be hosted on a remote server, commonly dubbed as cloud—a jargon coined by tech people trying to be posh and poetic.

I'm not against the jargon or the people. After all, I am one of them, and I speak such jargons frequently (for work and fun) that the generations of my parents and before rarely use, even if they are able to understand. Nevertheless, it becomes increasingly clear to me that, when jargons enters public domain, they turn into buzzwords immediately—below I quote the meaning of buzzword according to the online Cambridge Dictionary:
> *a word or expression from a particular subject area that has become fashionable by being used a lot*

—yes, trying to be posh it is.

Apparently, being posh have a 'best before' date. In the case of clouds, or remote servers, or more specifically, writing/blogging and hosting/archiving one's blog on a remote server has sadly become a unsustainable business. It was probabily unprofitable since its booming two decades ago
