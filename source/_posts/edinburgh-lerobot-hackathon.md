The first time I visited Edinburgh was more than a decade ago. As a student tourist of a group of twenty or thirty, I didn't event remember if I visited the castle—what can be recalled is the night started earlier than anticipated when I was walking along Princess Street back and forth, trying to find a cheap place for dinner.

Last Saturday and Sunday, it was my first time participating in a hackathon, any hackathon. This event[^1], in particular, was for open-source robotics. It was the first time I worked with a robot arm, and just a few days ago when I registered for the event was the first time I learned about LeRobot. Moreoever, I had never met almost all the other participants until the event—what wasn't new to me was the local food I had for lunch.

[^1] : The primary [hackathon](https://huggingface.co/LeRobot-worldwide-hackathon) was organised by huggingface. The event was worldwide and free to participate—One needed to buy (or make) their own robot parts if they wanted to play with the hardware instead of simulation. Luckily I joined the local Edinburgh [event](https://lerobot-edinburgh.com/), organised by [Antreas Antoniou](http://antreas.io/) and [Pavlos Andreadis](https://people.inf.ed.ac.uk/Pavlos_Andreadis.html), where [robot arms](https://github.com/TheRobotStudio/SO-ARM100) were provided. Big thanks to all of them!

# Preparation
As our local event was advertised to everybody with the only constraint on capacity of travelling to central Edinburgh but no requirement on technical knowledge or skills, I registered without too much hesitation—I've collaborated with roboticists to deploy and validated my AI model earlier and I'd love more hands-on experience playing with robots myself. For the same reason, Edinburgh participants hadn't been asked to prepare anything but a laptop that could run LeRobot and a GPU-powered one if
