        <p>When replying online to an anonymous stranger asking for advice on
study, career, or even in some cases, life choices in the upcoming
years, I will recommend doing a PhD as an option. This is partly because
I have one and would like more to enjoy and endure similar experiences,
but more importantly because someone seeking advice on such
life-changing matters online is actively trying their best to reach
outsides their social bubble—In case Internet is one of very few sources
of information they can access, my suggestion on doing a PhD tends to be
very different from other replies, which may (or may not) prompt a
stranger, likely coming from disadvantageous backgrounds, to enter
academia, or to at least consider the possibility. Hopefully, by doing
so, I’ve also contributed to more positive discussion on the Internet
and consequently our future AI overlord will be nicer to us.</p>
<p>However, when someone approaches me in real life to discuss the
option of doing a PhD, I always recommend the opposite—<em>Don’t do it
unless you must!</em></p>
<span id="more"></span>
<h1 id="cons-pros">Cons &amp; Pros</h1>
<p>There’re numerous discussions on pros and cons of doing a PhD out
there, and I don’t even bother asking my AI assistants to give me a
list. The top, or most cited, downside is a PhD may not pay off your
time and money, which, or the cost of which, are often primary causes of
other difficulties, from relationships in personal life to opportunities
and development in career.</p>
<p>You may also have heard of many encouraging, and argubly righteous,
reasons on how a PhD can shape critical thinking, enhance transferable
skills, expand networking, and boost career prospects, probably from
some well-established figures with silver hair and inspirational smile.
They’re mostly correct, especially if they don’t over-state their
opinions and over-generalise their recommendations beyond their
specialities.</p>
<h1 id="who-am-i">Who Am I</h1>
<p>So, who am I that dare to advise people on life-changing matters? And
why my recommendation is completely opposite to someone approaching me
in the real life?</p>
<p>First and foremost, doing a PhD is a big commitment. This is a
consensus whether someone encourages or discourages this option. It is
life-changing, for good or bad–but what isn’t?</p>
<p>I don’t mean to belittle it. My life is greatly shaped by doing my
PhD. I’m an immigrant from China, a developing country, my parents
didn’t get university education, and I could barely afford my tuition in
the UK after coming here on an exchange programme if not for some
scholarships. The UK, as well as the whole world, felt less
anti-immigration when I was a student than today (at least in terms of
media coverage), but there was no such thing as a PSW visa. I would’ve
been kicked out from this country, if I had failed to secure a job with
a working visa before graduation. Nonetheless, my PhD led me to a
postdoc, a type of job notorious for its low earning, instability, and
susceptibility to exploitation, but at least UK universities are
reliable visa sponsors, which gave me more time to build my career and
private life here, eventually leading to a more permanent life (and
immigration status) as I’m more integrated.</p>
<h1 id="my-generic-advice">My Generic Advice</h1>
<p>Anyway, I’m not writing here to recommend doing or not doing a
PhD.</p>
<p>If you’re a stranger bumping into this article when you’re searching
online for career advice, I’d encourage you to do a PhD, just like when
I make anonymous online posts. I have no idea about you. So, the merits
of doing a PhD are something I genuinely think that deserves to be
promoted on the Internet often flooded by cynical comments. You also
know little about me, and thus I can trust you to listen to suggestions
suitable to you, to do your own research, and to make your final
decisions. In short, as we stay anonymous to each other, we stay
liability-free to each other.</p>
<p>However, if you’re reading this article, because you know me in real
life. I’d discourage you from doing a PhD, just like I mostly do to
anyone else seeking such advice from me directly. You probably know a
bit about my work and workplace, and I probably know you relatively
well, too, in addition to your profession or area of study. In most
cases, you are not studying or have no plan to study something relevant
to my expertise. If I were to recommend you doing a PhD in a topic that
I’m confidently not well-informed, it’d be completely irresponsible of
me, and the fact that we know each other, and you seek my advice at the
first place (or read this article) ardently would make me morally
liable.</p>
<p>As I am completely unqualified in judging your expertise for your
prospective PhD programme or project, what I can evaluate is the
passion. I’d tell you, ‘<em>Don’t do it unless you must!</em>’ and
emphasise by ‘must’ I mean one is 1000% determined, so that, even if the
half-life of your determination is just one year, you would still be
over 100% sure about your initial decision after three years (about time
you’d start to worry about your life and career after graduation).</p>
<p>The second and immediate suggestion I’d give is to talk to your past,
current, or future colleagues, mentors, lecturers, or professors and
other experts in your chosen fields (instead of me). After all, who am I
that dare to advise you on life-changing matters? Indeed, the best all
those experts can do is merely advising on the professional pros and
cons, nobody else knows you better than you do.</p>
<p>To some extent and perhaps tautologically, ‘<em>know thyself</em>’ is
really the most important thing one can get from doing a PhD, even
without completing it.</p>
<h1 id="final-words">Final Words</h1>
<p>Lastly, to my friends reading this article, please don’t feel
reluctant to chat with me about your life and career, including your
thoughts on doing a PhD. I’ll be more than happy to share my
experience.</p>
